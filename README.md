We're going to have you all work on a project called REU Manager. REU stands for Research Experiences for Undergraduates. You can learn more about the REU program at National Science Foundation's site https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5517
REU Manager is a multi-tenant, Ruby on Rails application designed for students to apply for REU opportunities and for the faculty to review, accept and reject the applications. You'll be helping to build out a new and improved version of the application that we're hoping to launch this fall.
